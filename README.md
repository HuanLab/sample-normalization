## Part 1: Protocol for evidence-based normalization
The document `norm_protocol` is provided to guide users on ensuring optimal normalization results. This walkthrough goes through experimental planning, data acquisition, and data preprocessing. The end result is a normalized feature table. In `norm_protocol`, R code is provided. The code can be directly copied and pasted in the user's computer for processing of their own datasets.

## Part 2: Code for the benchmarking of normalization methods
The R code used in the study to simulate and benchmark post-acquisition sample normalization methods is provided in  `norm_simulations`. The document `initial_values` is used to initiate the simulations.
